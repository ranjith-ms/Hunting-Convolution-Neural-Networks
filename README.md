# Hunting-Convolution-Neural-Networks
  This Repo contains the programs that are illustred in my book "Hunting Convolutional Neural Network" available at https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07PCS11LW
  This book deals with one of the hot topic in artificial intelligence, Computer vison which has grown a lot in recent years due to what is known as Convolution Neural Networks. Which will be discussed throughout the book. The book assumes that you are familiar with the traditional neural networks and with prior experience in python programming.

Skills You will learn:

•Convolution Neural Networks

•Creating a dataset from scratch

•Tensorflow

•Keras

•Fastai

•Resnets

•Neural Style Transfer
